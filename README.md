# Algorithmic-Thinking
*Part of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, Rice, Coursera*

###Course Syllabus
- Graphs and brute-force algorithms
- Algorithmic efficiency and BFS
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming

###project
- Degree distributions for graphs
- Connected components and graph resilience
- Closest pairs and clustering algorithms
- Alignment of sequences

###Application
